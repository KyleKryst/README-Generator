## README-Generator ##

  ## Description ##
  My motivation to make this project was to easily be able to create a well structured README file. I built this project so I can quickly create my README file so I that I can put more of my focus on the actual coding. Now with this project completed, it will save users the time it takes to write out an entire README file. I learned throughout this project how to run prompts through the integrated terminal in VS Code and then structure it into a README file with markdown that encompasses the purpose of the project.
